 * Implementation of Silver and Gold problem from JOB-A-Thon contest gfg
 * 
 * Problem statement:
 * 
 * There are N coins kept in a line. Each coin has two sides - one is colored gold
 * and the other silver. You can flip two adjacent coins any number of times. You need to make 
 * the gold-colored side of every coin facing up. You are given the initial status of coins
 * in a binary string s where 1 represents the gold side facing up and 0 represents the silver
 * side facing up. If it is possible to make the gold-colored side of every coin facing up,
 * return 'Yes', otherwise return 'No'

 * Flipping 3rd and 4th coin together and 7th and 8th coin together will do the task.
