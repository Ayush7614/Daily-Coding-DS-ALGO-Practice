/*Problem : Find all triplets with zero sum*/

/*Explanation of problem : Given an array of distinct elements. The task is to find triplets in the array whose sum is zero.*/
/*Approach : 
    a> Sort the array in ascending order and traverse the array from start to end.
    b> For every index i, create two variables l = i + 1 and r = n â€“ 1
    c> Run a loop until l is less than r if the sum of array[l], array[r] is equal to zero then print the triplet and break the loop
    d> If the sum is less than zero then increment the value of l, by increasing the value of l the sum will increase as the array is sorted, so array[l+1] > array [l]
    e> If the sum is greater than zero then decrement the value of r, by increasing the value of l the sum will decrease as the array is sorted, so array[r-1] < array [r].
