# Python3 program to Count occurrences
# of an element in a sorted array 
# Approach :Improved Binary Search
# Time Complexity : O(Logn)

# If x is present in a[] then 
# return the number of occurrences
# of x, otherwise returns -1.
# Example:
# Input : a[] = {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,} , x = 2
# Output : 5

	# to obtain the index of first occurence
	# of x in a[]
	i = first(a, 0, n-1, x, n)

	# If x absent in
	# a[] then return -1
	if i == -1:
		return i
	
	# If x present then obtain last occurence of x
        # in a[] but in subarray with starting index as i
	j = last(a, i, n-1, x, n);	
	
	# return count
	return j-i+1;

# If x is present in the array a[] then return
# the index of first occurrence of x 
# otherwise return -1

	if high >= low:
    
		mid = (low + high)//2

			return mid
		elif x > a[mid]:
			return first(a, (mid + 1), high, x, n)
