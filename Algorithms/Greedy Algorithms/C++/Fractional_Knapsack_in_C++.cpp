//---------FRACTIONAL KNAPSACK---------//

/*
Problem link is:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/fractional-knapsack-1587115620/1

Problem Statement:Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack
of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item. 
*/

/* 
Logic :
An efficient solution is to use Greedy approach. The basic idea of the greedy approach is to 
calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. Then
take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a whole 
and at the end add the next item as much as we can. Which will always be the optimal solution 
to this problem.
A simple code with our own comparison function can be written as follows, please see sort function 
more closely, the third argument to sort function is our comparison function which sorts the item 
according to value/weight ratio in non-decreasing order. 
After sorting we need to loop over these items and add them in our knapsack satisfying above-mentioned
criteria.
