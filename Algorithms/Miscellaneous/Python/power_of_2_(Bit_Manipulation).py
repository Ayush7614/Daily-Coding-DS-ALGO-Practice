# Python program to check if given
# number is power of 2 or not

 ''' If we subtract a power of 2 numbers by 1 then all unset bits after the only set bit become set; and the set bit become unset.

For example for 4 ( 100) and 16(10000), we get following after subtracting 1
3 –> 011
15 –> 01111


Input:
 Enter Number

 Output:
     YES
Input:
 Enter Number

 Output:
