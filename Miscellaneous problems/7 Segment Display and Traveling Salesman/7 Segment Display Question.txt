Note: Gray dots represent spaces

Q1. Write a program to print a 3-digit number in the above format for n = 3.
2. Write a program to print any given number in the above format for any given n. 

(A digit is (2*n + 3) lines tall and (n + 3) characters wide, and one additional space is added to separate every digit of the number.)
