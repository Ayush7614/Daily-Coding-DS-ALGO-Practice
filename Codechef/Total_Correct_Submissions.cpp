CODECHEF PROBLEM- TOTCRT

Problem Link: https://www.codechef.com/START5C/problems/TOTCRT/

Problem Statement: 
Codechef challenges have three divisions. In one challenge, there are N problems in each division, but some problems may be shared among multiple divisions. Each problem is uniquely identified by a code â€” a string containing only uppercase English letters. Each participant can only submit in one of the divisions.
Chef wants to find the number of correct solutions, in total among all 3 divisions, for each problem. Given a list of N problem codes with the numbers of correct solutions for each problem in each division, find the total number of correct solutions for each problem and sort them in non-decreasing order.

Z 100

Output-
1 2 3
1 1 2 2
300


Explanation:
Example case 1: There is only 1 problem in each division and no problems are shared among divisions, so the total number of distinct problems is 3 and the numbers of solutions are: 1 for "A", 2 for "B", 3 for "C".

Example case 2: There are 2 problems in each division and each pair of consecutive divisions shares 1 problem, so the total number of distinct problems is 4 and the numbers of solutions are: 1 for "AA", 2 for "AB", 2 for "AC", 1 for "AD". We need to sort them in non-decreasing order, so the final answer is (1,1,2,2).

Example case 3: There is only 1 problem "Z" in the entire contest, shared among all divisions, and the number of solutions for it is 300.
