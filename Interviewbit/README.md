[My InterviewBit Profile](https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/2018csb1090_05afa8884f71)

## Information
The repository contains solutions to various [programming problems](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) on InterviewBit. The code is merely a snippet (as solved on InterviewBit) & hence is not executable in a c++ compiler.
<br/>
**The code written is purely original & completely my own.**

## How to contribute?

1. Fork the repository 
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

## When to contribute?

1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution & make a pull request with your solution.
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file & make a pull request.
5. If your solution is memory efficient, comment your solution in the main file & make a pull request.
