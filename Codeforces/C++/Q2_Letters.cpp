Problem Statement:
There are n dormitories in Berland State University, they are numbered with integers from 1 to n.
Each dormitory consists of rooms, there are ai rooms in i-th dormitory. The rooms in i-th dormitory 
are numbered from 1 to ai.

A postman delivers letters. Sometimes there is no specific dormitory and room number in it on an 
envelope. Instead of it only a room number among all rooms of all n dormitories is written on an 
envelope. In this case, assume that all the rooms are numbered from 1 to a1+a2+â‹¯+an and the rooms 
of the first dormitory go first, the rooms of the second dormitory go after them and so on.

For example, in case n=2, a1=3 and a2=5 an envelope can have any integer from 1 to 8 written on it.
If the number 7 is written on an envelope, it means that the letter should be delivered to the room
number 4 of the second dormitory.

For each of m letters by the room number among all n dormitories, determine the particular dormitory
and the room number in a dormitory where this letter should be delivered.
