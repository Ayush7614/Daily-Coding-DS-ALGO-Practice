/*Question- You are given a positive integer n, it is guaranteed that n is even (i.e. divisible by 2).

You want to construct the array a of length n such that:

The first n2 elements of a are even (divisible by 2);
the second n2 elements of a are odd (not divisible by 2);
all elements of a are distinct and positive;
the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half (∑i=1n2ai=∑i=n2+1nai).
If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.

You have to answer t independent test cases.
