Description : Variable Sized Arrays

Consider an n-element array, a , where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of k(i) integers.
Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in array a and j denotes an index in the array located at a[i] .
For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location a[i] on a new line.

Input Format :
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i] .
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array a) and j (an index in the array referenced by a[i]) 
for a query.

Constraints : 
1<= n <= 10^5
1<= q <= 10^5
1<= k <= 3* 10^5
n<= E k <= 3* 10^5
0<= i < n
0<= j < k
All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 10^6

Output Format : 
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i]. 
There should be a total of q lines of output.

Sample Input : 
2 2
3 1 5 4
5 1 2 8 9 3
0 1
1 3

Sample Output : 
5
9

Explanation : 
We perform the following q=2 queries:
Find the array located at index i=0, which corresponds to a[0] = [1,5,4]. We must print the value at index j=1 of this array which, as you can see, is 5 .
Find the array located at index i=1, which corresponds to a[1] = [1,2,8,9,3] . We must print the value at index j=3 of this array which, as you can see, is 9 .
