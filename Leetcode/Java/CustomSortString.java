/* Implementation of Custom Sort String problem using Java
 * 
 * You are given two strings order and str. All the words of order are unique and 
 * were sorted in some custom order previously.

 * Permute the characters of str so that they match the order that order was sorted. 
 * More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x 
 * should occur before y in the permuted string.

 * Return any permutation of str that satisfies this property.

        CustomSortString obj = new CustomSortString();
        System.out.println(obj.customSortString(s,t));
    }
}

/*
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
 * Output: "cbad"
 * Explanation: 
 * "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
 * Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"
 * Output: "cbad"
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(order.length + str.length)
