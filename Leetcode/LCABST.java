/*test cases
Input: LCA of 10 and 14
Output:  12
Explanation: 12 is the closest node to both 10 and 14 
which is a ancestor of both the nodes.

Input: LCA of 8 and 14
Output:  8
Explanation: 8 is the closest node to both 8 and 14 
which is a ancestor of both the nodes.

Input: LCA of 10 and 22
Output:  20
Explanation: 20 is the closest node to both 10 and 22 
which is a ancestor of both the nodes.*/
