/*
Problem Statement

Given a list of strings words and a string pattern, return a list of words[i] that match pattern. You may return the answer in any order.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter. 

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.

Constraints:
1 <= pattern.length <= 20
1 <= words.length <= 50
words[i].length == pattern.length
pattern and words[i] are lowercase English letters.

/*
Time Complexity: O(N∗K), where N is the number of words, and K is the length of each word.
Space Complexity: O(N∗K), the space used by the answer.
